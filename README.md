# Machine Learning and Data Science

1. Cats and Dogs Image Detection and Classification - Graduate Mini Project (MS CS)
- Created a Homegrown Linear Regression model with Lasso and SGD for bound box detection and a 
Homegrown Logistic Regression model for both object detection and classification. Extended the loss function from CXE to 
CXE + MSE.
- Deviced baseline scikit-learn models with Grid Search and Pipelines for classification and regression. Best object 
classification model: SVM. Best regression model: Elastic Net 
- Built Multilayer Perceptron models for classification and regression with Drop-out and Batch normalization and ReLU 
activation function.
- Constructed a Multi-headed cat-dog detector using the OOP API in PyTorch with a combined loss function of CXE + MSE.

2. Cellular Image Classification using Deep Learning Techniques
- An independent research project for Cyberinfrastructure for Network Science Center(CNS) with cellular image data (80 GB).
- Created a CNN Homegrown model and utilized the power of ResNet and EfficientNet B1 for classification.

3. Handwritten Digit Classification
- In this notebook, i have used MNIST dataset, which is a set of 70,000 small
images of digits handwritten by high school students and employees of the US Census
Bureau (60,000 training and 10,000 for blind testing).
- Here, I have performed Multi-class, Multi-Label and Multi-Output classification and compared accuracy scores for various classification algorithms.
- I have utilized various performance metrics such as confusion matrix and ROC-AUC curves to decide best classification models.

4. Feature Engineering with Custom Data Transformers
- When conducting an end to end Machine Learning project, after exploring and preprocessing the data it is essential to think of feature engineering. 
It consists of creating new feature(s) based on the features that already exist in the dataset that can be useful for training the model.
- To help with feature engineering, this notebook shows how we could create custome data transformers. 
- I have also conducted grid search to find the best algorithm with the best parameters for our problem statement.

5. Deep learning playground with Boston House Price Prediction
- Created basic deep learning piplines for house price prediction.
- RegNet: Constructed a simple fully connected neural network.
- Compared the results of model with Sequential and OOP APIs.
